You've described a series of steps to create directories and files. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create the main branch directory:
   ```
   mkdir MainBranch
   cd MainBranch
   ```

2. Create Dir1 and Dir2:
   ```
   mkdir Dir1
   mkdir Dir2
   ```

3. Go to Dir1 and create DirA and DirB:
   ```
   cd Dir1
   mkdir DirA
   mkdir DirB
   ```

4. Go back to the main branch and go to Dir2, then create Dirc and Dird:
   ```
   cd ..
   cd Dir2
   mkdir Dirc
   mkdir Dird
   ```

5. Go to DirA and create File1 and File2:
   ```
   cd ../Dir1/DirA
   touch File1
   touch File2
   ```

6. Go back to Dir1 and select DirB, then create File3 and File4:
   ```
   cd ..
   cd DirB
   touch File3
   touch File4
   ```

7. Go back to the main branch and select DirC, then create File5 and File6:
   ```
   cd ../../
   cd Dir2/Dirc
   touch File5
   touch File6
   ```

8. Go back to the main branch and select DirD, then create File7 and File8:
   ```
   cd ../../
   cd Dir2/Dird
   touch File7
   touch File8
   ```

Now, you've created the directory structure and files according to your instructions.
